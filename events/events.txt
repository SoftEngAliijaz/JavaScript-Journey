// JavaScript Events

// What are events?
// Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, which the browser can respond to. Examples of events include when a user clicks a button, submits a form, or presses a key.

// Why do we use events?
// Events are used to make web pages interactive. By responding to events, we can create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. For example, we can validate form input, create animations, or update content without reloading the page.

// How to use events?
// To use events in JavaScript, you can add event listeners to HTML elements. An event listener is a function that will be called when the specified event occurs. You can add event listeners using the `addEventListener` method.

document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button was clicked!');
});

// How many events are there?
// There are many different types of events in JavaScript, including mouse events, keyboard events, form events, and more. Here are some of the most important events:

// Important events:
// 1. click - Fired when an element is clicked.
// 2. mouseover - Fired when the mouse pointer is moved onto an element.
// 3. mouseout - Fired when the mouse pointer is moved out of an element.
// 4. keydown - Fired when a key is pressed down.
// 5. keyup - Fired when a key is released.
// 6. submit - Fired when a form is submitted.
// 7. change - Fired when the value of an input element changes.
// 8. load - Fired when the whole page has loaded.
// 9. unload - Fired when the page is unloaded.
// 10. resize - Fired when the window is resized.

// Example of using some important events:

// Click event
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button was clicked!');
});

// Mouseover event
document.getElementById('myElement').addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
    console.log('Mouse is over the element');
});

// Keydown event
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    console.log('Key pressed: ' + event.key);
});

// Submit event
document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the form from submitting
    alert('Form submitted!');
});
